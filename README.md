# Skills Tracker
A public review of structured learning paths across multiple platforms.

# 🧠 Learning in Public: The Dev Journey Log

I start from the ground up to reinforce core concepts, because keeping old skills sharp is just as important as building new ones. I will review each platform and try to provide feedback aimed at learners, educators, and platform designers.

## 🔍 What This Repo Contains

- **Platform-based subfolders** with notes, reflections, and key takeaways
- Light commentary on course material
- Project code and safe-to-share visual highlights.
- Personal progress notes

## 🚀 Platforms Tracked So Far

## ✍️ Why Track It Publicly?

- For myself: Writing makes learning stick. It also reveals what I don’t yet understand.
- For you: These notes can serve as a preview for anyone considering the same platforms, or just curious how different skills overlap.

This log is a way to:
- Reflect critically on what I’ve learned
- Spot gaps in my understanding
- Help others see what real learning roadmaps look like

## ⚡ About Me

I’m a self-directed developer focused on full stack tools, secure systems, and the implications of AI on learning, freedom, and infrastructure. This repo complements my practice projects, portfolio, and certification tracks.

## 📌 A Note on Notes

My note-taking strategy may look unusual if you haven't experienced it before, but it's designed for long-term retention, not just passive review. The core idea is simple: memory strengthens when we process information actively, in our own words. To that end, I use the following approach for all technical and conceptual material:

1. Read one paragraph
2. Summarise the paragraph in a single sentence—short enough to fit on one line
3. Write another one-line summary capturing the overall progress so far (book, module, room, etc.)
4. Repeat for each new paragraph

This creates paired summary sentences for every concept. It may appear repetitive, but repetition is intentional — it forces active recall and strengthens understanding through concise restatement.

_Note: This method feels slow initially, but saves time in the long run by reducing the need to re-read material before exams or reviews. With practice, summarising becomes fast and instinctive._

### 📚 Reviewing Summary Pair Notes

Another key principle of learning is that forgetting isn't failure—it's part of the process. Memory improves when we forget, then get reminded. Think of how you effortlessly remember your favourite band's discography—not because you studied it, but because you were repeatedly reminded by listening.

The same applies here:
- Leave your notes untouched long enough to partially forget them
- Review them later—the sensation of "remembering forgotten things" accelerates long-term retention
- This spaced reminder effect builds knowledge that lasts.
