A public review of structured learning paths across multiple platforms.

# 🧠 Learning in Public: The Dev Journey Log

I start from the ground up to reinforce core concepts, because keeping old skills sharp is just as important as building new ones. I will review each platform and try to provide feedback aimed at learners, educators, and platform designers.

## 🔍 What This Repo Contains

- **Platform-based subfolders** with notes, reflections, and key takeaways
- Light commentary on course material
- Project code and safe-to-share visual highlights.
- Personal progress notes

## ✍️ Why Track It Publicly?

- For myself: Writing makes learning stick. It also reveals what I don’t yet understand.
- For you: These notes can serve as a preview for anyone considering the same platforms, or just curious how different skills overlap.

This log is a way to:
- Reflect critically on what I’ve learned
- Spot gaps in my understanding
- Help others see what real learning roadmaps look like
