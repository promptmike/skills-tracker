# What is Networking?

## Task 1 - What is Networking?

A network is simply things connected, such as a postal service, railway system or group of friends.
The term network can refer to any connection system that links things together.

In computing specifically, a network is the connection between technological devices.
Networks are things connected, which can include computers and smart devices.

A computer network can connect any number of devices, which may appear in area you would not expect, such as farming.
Networks are things connected, which can include computers and smart devices in places you might not expect.

Networks are integrated into everyday life, such as gathering weather data or providing utilities, making them important to secure.
Networks are things connected, including the computers and smart devices in our everyday lives, making them important to secure.

## Task 2 - What is the Internet?

Now that we have learned what a network is (devices connected) we can explore the internet.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected, one example of which is the internet.

Networks can consist of many smaller Networks, but sometimes this requires translation as the Smaller Networks speak different languages.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected, and Networks can connect to each other to form larger Networks.

The first internet was ARPANET developed by USDD in the 1960s, but the WWW we know today was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected, sometimes connecting to form larger Networks, including the WWW.

Networks may be private or public, and Public Networks can connect Private Networks to form a larger Network like the internet.
Private Networks are technological devices connected, which can in turn connect to each other to form Public Networks.

## Task 3 - Identifying Devices on a Network

Devices on a Network must identify themselves to each other, just as we must know who we are talking to when we have a conversation.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected and identifiable by one-another.

Devices on a network are similar to people in that there are two ways we can be identified - our names or our fingerprints.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected and identifieable by one-another in various ways.

We can change our names, but not our fingerprints, and computers are the same having both an IP Address and an MAC address.
Computer Networks are technological devices connected to and identifiable by one-another by addresses such as IP or MAC.

### IP Addresses

An Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) is associated with a device for a period of time to identify and connect to it.
Computer Networks are devices connected and reachable by both fixed and temporary addresses.

An IP Address consists of four octets and can be reused, but can only appear once at a time on a given network.
Computer Networks are devices connected and reachable by unique addresses, either fixed or temporary.

IP addresses follow standards known as Protocols and can be assigned on both Public and Private Networks.
Computer Networks are devices connected, publicly or privately, and reachable by unique addresses, either fixed or temporary.

A Public Address is used to identify a device on the Internet, while a Private Address is used to identify amongst other devices.
Computer Networks consist of connected devices, can be Public or Private, and require unique addresses either fixed or temporary.

Private IP Addresses connect devices on the same Network, but the Internet requries Public IP Addresses provided for a fee by an ISP.
Private Networks connect devices with Private Addresses, and Internet Service Providers connect them together with Public Addresses.

The four octets IP Addresses are IPv4, but new versions will be needed so we don't run out of unique Public Addresses.
Private Networks connect devices with Private Addresses, while Internet Access requries a unique Public Address provided by an ISP.

IPv6 is a newer IP scheme designed to prevent address conflicts by providing 2^128 addresses instead of IPv4's 2^32 addresses.
Private Networks require a unique Public Address to connect to Public Networks, so it is important not to run out of IP Addresses.

### MAC Addresses

Physical network interfaces have fixed MAC Addresses of 12 colon-separated hexadecimal characters (first 6 are company).
Networked devices have a fixed MAC Address and are then assigned a Private IP Address and a Public IP Address for internet access.

Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses can be spoofed to exploit the trust of other devices on the network.
Devices have a fixed MAC Address and are assigned Private and Public IP Addresses, but addresses can be spoofed.

Public WiFi often uses MAC Addresses to offer different services to different devices, but this could be spoofed.
Devices are identified by a unique MAC Address and are assigned Private and Public IP Addresses, but addresses can be spoofed.

### Practical

The practical task has Bob spoof Alice's MAC Address to access WiFi he has not paid for.
Devices are identified by unique MAC Address and assigned Private and Public IP Addresses on Networks, but addresses can be spoofed.

## Task 4 - Ping(ICMP)

Ping is a Network tool that uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to test connection between devices.
Networking is the Private and Public connection and addressing of devices using protocols.

Ping measures the time taken for packets to move between devices, using ICMP Echo and Echo Reply packets.
Networking is the Private and Public connection and addressing of devices using protocols to share packets of data.

Pings can be performed against devices or services, and the tool to do so comes pre-installed on Operating Systems.
Networking is the Private and Public connection and addressing of devices using protocols to share and measure packets of data.

If we give the command `ping [IP Address or URL]` we get the number of packets received and the time taken.
Networking is the Private and Public connection and addressing of devices sending packets to each other using protocols.

Pinging the address in the task will reveal a flag.
THM provides CTF to learn the protocols used by Networks to send and receive packets of data between devices.

## Task 5 - Continue Your Learning: Intro to LAN

Continue to learn in the Intro to LAN room.
