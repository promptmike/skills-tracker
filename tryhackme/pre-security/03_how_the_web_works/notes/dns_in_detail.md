# DNS in Detail

## Task 1 - What is DNS?

Domain Name System (DNS) allows us to access devices remotely without remembering their IP Addresses.
DNS makes it possible to visit a website with its URL so you don't need to remember the IP Address of the server.

## Task 2 - Domain Hierarchy

### Domain Hierarchy

#### TLD (Top-Level Domain)

Generic Top Level Domains (gTLD) tell us the purpose of a site, while Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLD) tell us geographic location.
The right-hand part of a Domain Name is the TLD, which can be Generic or Country Code.

#### Second-Level Domain

The Second Level Domain is limited to 63 characters of a-z, 0-9 and hyphens, but cannot start or end with a hyphen or have consecutive hyphens.
TLD goes on the right to tell us purpose or location, SLD comes before .tld and must meet strict character requirements.

#### Subdomain

Subdomains have the same restrictions as SLD, but you can have multiple Subdomains provided the total length is 253 characters or less.
TLD goes on the right, SLD before it and Subdomain or multiple Subdomains before SLD.
