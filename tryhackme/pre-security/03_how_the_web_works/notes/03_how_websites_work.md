# How Websites Work

## Task 1 - How websites work

You must know how websites work to understand the security implications of them.
You will learn how websites work with THM so that you can find vulnerabilities in websites.

A Server is a dedicated computer that handles your Requests for information.
Your Browser sends a Request to a Server to view a particular page and the Server Responds with data that your Browser uses to display the page.

The Front-End (Client-Side) of a website is handled by the browser, while the Back-End (Server-Side) is handled by the Server.
Your Browser sends Requests to Servers which process Back-End data and send the resulting Front-End data back to the Browser.

You make a Request to a Server and it responds with data your Browser can use to display information to you.
Servers process Back-End data and use it to respond to Requests from your Browser which then uses Front-End data to display information for you.

## Task 2 - HTML

Websites are mainly built from HTML for content and layout, CSS for styling and Javascript for complex interactive features.
Servers process Back-End data and send Front-End HTML, CSS and Javascript to your Browser to use for displaying pages to you.

HTML is the basic language web pages are written in, and it consists of tags telling your Browser how to handle content.
Servers process Back-End data and sent Front-End HTML to your Browser to give it the page layout, with CSS and Javascript for additional data.
