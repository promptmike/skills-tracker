# Offensive Security Intro

## Task 1 - What is Offensive Security?

"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."
We must learn attacks to prevent them.

Offensive security involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting bugs and finding loopholes.
We must exploit systems to learn their weaknesses.

### Beginning Your Learning Journey

This room guides you through your first attack.
We practice attacks in a legal and safe environment to understand security.

Labs return to their initial state after use.
We exploit test machines legally to understand vulnerabilities.

## Task 2 - Starting the Lab

TryHackMe uses interactive labs as complements to rooms.
We study security while simultaneously applying skills in a safe environment to understand computer systems.

Click Start Machine to load the Fake Bank training exercise.
Virtual machines allow us to practice and reinforce skills as we learn cybersecurity principles.

TryHackMe enters splitscreen mode to show both the learning material and virtual machine side by side.
We study learning material and practice our new skills side-by-side to develop cybersecurity proficiency.

## Task 3 - Your First Hack

### Briefing

The first task is to test a virtual bank.
We study cybersecurity principles side-by-side with realistic practical exercises to understand computer security.

Finding secret URLs allows us to exploit websites.
Study security exploits side-by-side with practical exercises to gain cybersecurity proficiency.

Tools like dirb can brute-force secret URLs by searching commonly used names.
Study security exploits while simultaneously training with real tools.

### Opening A Terminal

A lot of tools must be run using commands from the terminal.
Study cybersecurity principles while running real commands for security tools.

You can open a terminal by clicking the terminal icon.
We study computer vulnerabilities while executing terminal commands for real security tools in a safe environment.

### Using dirb To Find Hidden Website Pages

The syntax for dirb is **dirb [target url]**.
Learn terminal commands for exploit tools while studying vulnerabilities in a safe and legal environment.

Running dirb returns a list of promising URLs to exploit.
Practice terminal commands for exploit tools and learn to understand their outputs to develop cybersecurity skills.

The first section of dirb output shows the URL_BASE we scanned and the location of the wordlist we used.
Run exploit tools from the terminal and practice reading their outputs to practice cybersecurity.

The lines beginning with a **+** sign are the results of the dirb scan.
Run exploit tools such as dirb from the terminal and study the results to develop cybersecurity skill.

## Task 4 - Adding Funds to Your Account

Once dirb finds a hidden page you can copy it to a browser address bar to see the page content.
Run tools such as dirb from the terminal and practice using the outputs for exploits in a safe environment.

Hidden pages may allow you to use a site in a way it was not intended for.
Run tools like dirb from CLI to access hidden loopholes and exploit them in a safe environment.

If you completed the task you should be able to see funds added to the fake bank account.
Run tools like dirb from CLI to practice exploiting real vulnerabilities in a safe and legal environment side-by-side with studying computer principles.
