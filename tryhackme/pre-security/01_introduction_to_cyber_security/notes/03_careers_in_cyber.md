Cyber Security is a highly stimulating and well paid career.

This room introduces you to the paths you can take to enter the Cyber Security profession.
Cyber Security is a highly rewarding career that you can enter by achieving proficiency in certain learning paths.

## Task 2 - Security Analyst

Security Analysts are responsible for providing actionable data to protect the digital assets of their organisation.
Security Analysts perform a vital role in Cyber Security, a highly rewarding career.

### Responsibilities

Security Analysts work with stakeholders, provide ongoing documentation and perform regular updates to maintain organisation security.
Cyber Security is a highly rewarding field which includes Security Analysts who specialise in providing constant actionable data.

### Learning Paths

THM provides both the information and practice you need to become a security analyst.
Cyber Security includes Security Analysis, which THM can train you for with study and practice of techniques to provide actionable data.

## Task 3 - Security Engineer

Security Engineers develop and implement solutions informed by data gathered from the security workforce.
Security Analysts gather data on risks, threats and incidents while Security Engineers use this data to design solutions.

### Responsibilities

Security Engineers must monitor networks and reports to identify security systems that are required, then implement and test them.
Security Analysts gather data to detect and respond to threats, while Security Engineers harden systems against those threats.

### Learning Paths

TryHackMe offers learning paths to prepare you for a career as a Security Engineer.
THM paths can prepare you to prepare, detect and respond to threats as an Analyst or harden networks against them as an Engineer.

## Task 4 - Incident Responder

Incident Responders mitigate cyber attacks in real time, minimising mean time to detect, acknowledge and respond (MTTD, MTTA, MTTR).
THM prepares you to Analyse Incidents, Respond to Threats or Engineer security systems.

### Responsibilities

Incident Responders must plan and support incident response measures, maintain security practices and provide post-incident reporting.
Cyber Security has many specialisms, as professionals must gather data, respond to incidents and maintain security systems.

### Learning Paths

THM SOC1 learning path can prepare you to be an Incident Responder.
Cyber Security specialists perform Threat Intelligence, DFIR, Security Engineering and 4-stage Incident Response.

## Task 5 - Digital Forensics Examiner

A Digital Forensics Examiner analyses evidence to investigate crimes or policy violations.
Cyber Security professionals can specialise in Security Engineering, SOC Analysis (Threat Intelligence and DFIR), or just DF or IR.

### Responsibilities

Digital Forensics Examiners must follow legal procedures, gather relevant evidence, analyse it for relevant facts and report thoroughly.
Cyber Security professionals must follow legal procedures while Engineering, gathering Threat Intelligence or doing DFIR.

## Task 6 - Malware Analyst

A Malware Analyst studies malicious machine code to discover how it works.
Cyber Security professionals follow legal procudures while Engineering, Analysing Malware, conducting Threat Intelligence or doing DFIR.

### Responsibilities

A Malware Analyst does static analysis (reverse engineering) or dynamic analysis (controlled environment tests) and reports findings.
CyberSec specialists follow legal procedures and provide reports while doing Malware Analysis, Engineering, Threat Intelligence or DFIR.

## Task 7 - Penetration Tester

Penetration Testers (Pentesters, Ethical Hackers) uncover vulnerabilities to prevent real-world cyber attacks.
Cyber Security includes Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR and Penetration Testing.

### Responsibilities

Pentesters test systems, provide audits and assess security policies to provide reports that inform future attack prevention.
Cyber Security includes Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR and Penetration Testing to prevent attacks.

### Learning Paths

THM provides the hands-on practice to become a Penetration tester.
THM can help you learn Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR and Penetration Testing to prevent attacks.

## Task 8 - Red Teamer

While Pentesters look for vulnerabilities, Red Teamers test detection and response by covering their tracks and retaining access.
Cyber Security requires Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR, Pentesting and Red Teaming.

### Responsibilities

Red Teamers emulate real Threat Actors to assess and report on Security Controls, Threat Intelligence and Incident Response.
Cyber Security prepares for attacks using Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR, Pentesting and Red Teaming.

### Learning Paths

THM provides both the information and hands-on training to become a successful Red Teamer.
THM prepares you to mitigate attacks using Malware Analysis, Security Engineering, Threat Intelligence, DFIR, Pentesting and Red Teaming.

## Task 9 - Quiz

This room has provided an overview of the different roles in Cyber Security and a quiz to help see which one suits you best.
THM prepares you to choose and enter a specialism in SOC, Engineering, Malware Analysis, DF, IR, Pentesting or Red Teaming.
