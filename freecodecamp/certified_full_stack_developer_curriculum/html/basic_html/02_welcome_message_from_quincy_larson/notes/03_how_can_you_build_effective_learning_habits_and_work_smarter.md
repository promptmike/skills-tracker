# How Can You Build Effective Learning Habits and Work Smarter?

For rigourous learning you must work both hard and smart.
fCC requires hard and smart work.

Quincy has met many developers and learned from them.
fCC incorporates knowledge from professionals about how to work hard and smart.

Pace yourself - 30 minutes per day is better than cramming.
fCC encourages professional learning practices such as good pacing.

fCC's Spaced Repetition, Interleaving Practice and Active Recall will work with consistent practice.
fCC provides the techniques that work, but the student must consistently pace themself to benefit.

Most people will stop at some point, but the best thing you can do is be consistent.
fCC's Spaced Repetition, Interleaving Practice and Active Recall techniques will work if you are consistent.

Routine is your friend, because it negates the need for willpower to put in consistent effort.
fCC provides material that will work if you are consistent and stick to a Routine.

You may be busy, but the only way you will learn to code is by putting in the hours.
fCC provides material that works, but pacing and Routine are the responsibility of the student.

If you code for even 30 minutes a day you will make significant gains over the course of a year.
fCC's learning material will provide significant benefit in a year only if you code consistently.

Use the Pomodoro technique, named after the Italian tomato-shaped clock that you set for 25 minutes.
Pacing, Routine and Pomodoros will back up Spaced Repetition, Interleaving Practice and Active Recall.

The Pomodoro technique works by committing to at least 25 minutes of timed coding.
Pacing, Routine and Pomodoros support Spaced Repetition, Interleaving Practice and Active Recall for success.

The Pomodoro technique makes it a lot easier to get started.
Code every day at the same time for at least 25 minutes for best results.

You will code your own Pomodoro clock app as part of the fCC curriculum.
Code every day at the same time for at least 25 minutes, timed using your own clock app.

Get plenty of sleep to support healthy memory and learning.
Code every day at the same time for at least 25 minutes and get 8 hours of sleep every night.

You are now ready to dive into the curriculum.
Follow the fCC curriculum for at least 25 minutes at the same time every day and get at least 8 hours sleep.
