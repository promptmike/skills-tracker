fCC uses techniques such as Spaced Repetition and Interleaving Practice to enhance learning.

Active Recall prevents overestimation of skills by constantly testing them.
fCC uses accelerated learning techniques such as Spaced Repetition, Interleaving Practice and Active Recall.

fCC has incorporated all these techniques, but you can always go back if you are stuck.
