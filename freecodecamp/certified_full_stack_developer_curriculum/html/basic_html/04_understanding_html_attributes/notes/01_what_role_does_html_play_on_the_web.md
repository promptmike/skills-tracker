# What Role Does HTML Play on the Web?

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) represents the content and structure of webpages through the use of elements.
HTML powers the World Wide Web by forming the basis of web pages.

Most HTML elements begin with an `<opening tag>` and end with a `</closing tag>`, with content in between.
HTML represents the content and structure of web pages with elements consisting of content between tags.

Closing tags are distinguished by a **/** after the first **<**, but some elements called void elements lack a closing tag.
HTML represents the content and structure of web pages with content between tags and lone tags called void elements.

Tags contain attributes to specify their behaviour, and void elements have only attributes and no content: `<tag attribute="value">`.
HTML represents the content and structure of web pages with elements consisting of tags and their attributes and/or content.

`<img>` elements require a **src** attribute to point to the image source and should also have an **alt** attribute.

The **alt** attribute provides short, descriptive text for the image in the `<img>` tag.
