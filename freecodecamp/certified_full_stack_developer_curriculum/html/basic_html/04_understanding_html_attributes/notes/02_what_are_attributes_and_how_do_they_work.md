# What Are Attributes, and How Do They Work?

Attributes are values placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element to provide information or specify behaviour.
HTML elements contain attribute values to provide additional information or specify how they should behave.

The attribute name is followed by an equals sign, then quotes containing a value in the form of a string or number.
In `<element attribute="value">content</element>` the **value** provides information about the element or alters its behaviour.

The **href** attribute provides the URL for a link: `<a href="https://subdomain.domain.tld/directory?=query">My Link</a>`
HTML elements contain values called attributes which specify information and behaviour such as the URL a link should point to.

Just as links need a URL, images need a source specified by **src** and alternative text specified by **alt**.
HTML elements contain values called attributes which specify information and behaviour such as sources or alt text.

Source attributes like **href** and **src** are required for an element to work, but **alt** is also recommended for accesibility.
HTML elements contain attributes which may be necessary for them to work, or may be strongly recommended as best practices.

Some attributes use a different syntax, such as **checked**: `<input type="checkbox" checked>`
HTML attributes specify information and behaviour for elements, usually in the syntax **attribute="value"**, but not always.

The attributes **checked**, **disabled**, **readonly** and **required** do not require a value, because they are booleans.
HTML attributes specify information and behaviour for elements, usually with a value, but sometimes with a boolean.

HTML has many attributes you can use to customise the behaviour and appearance of pages, so you must learn best-practices.
HTML attributes specify information and behaviour for elements that is critical for content, structure, style and accessibility.
